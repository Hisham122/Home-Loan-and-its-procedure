# Home-Loan-and-its-procedure
One of the key phases of the home loan process is approval or sanction. The bank sends a certified offer letter as soon as the loan is sanctioned or authorized. The bank checks on the home property the applicant wishes to buy after the offer letter is formally approved by the applicant. The next move is the final registration of the contract after the bank has completed the technical and site estimations and the lawyer has cleared all of the paperwork. The bank's lawyer completes the loan papers, writes them, and has them stamped and signed. Following the completion of the documents, the borrower must sign the home loan agreement. The loan amount is given via check after the borrower signs the papers and everything is legally clear.
